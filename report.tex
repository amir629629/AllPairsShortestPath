\section*{Abstract}
\textbf{\small We will be comparing the run time of two separate algorithms for determing the shortest distance between
all pairs of vertices in a graph. The first algorithm is Bellman-Ford's, which was originally developed for
finding the shortest path between a single source vertex and all other vertices. We will extend this algorithm to find
all pairs shortest paths. The next algorithm is Floyd-Warshall's, which was created to solve this problem faster than
the extended Bellman-Ford algorithm.}

\section{Assignment}
\label{sec::assignment}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Implement Bellman-Ford's algorithm to find the length of the path between a source (s) and all other vertices.
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Extend Bellman-Ford's to find the length of the paths between all pairs of vertices.
    \end{itemize}
    \item Implement Floyd-Warshall's algorithm to find the length of the paths between all pairs of vertices.
    \item Calculate the run-time of all of the implemented algorithms.
    \item Run all of the benchmarks on both "all pairs shortest path" algorithms.
    \item Fill in the report analyzing the algorithms and their run-time.
    \item You may remove the Assignment section (\cref{sec::assignment}) before turning in the final report
\end{itemize}
